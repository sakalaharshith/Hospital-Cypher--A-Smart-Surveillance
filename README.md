# Hospital-Cypher--A-Smart-Surveillance
Hospital Cypher is an python based computer application that basically helps in reducing the spread of COVID-19 disease. This application is mainly divided into two parts. They are as follows:
1) Face-mask detection
2) Face recognition

This is an hospital based PC application that helps in reducing the spread of COVID-19 disease. We all know that hospital is an hotspot for the origin and spread of any disease and it is no different in the case of COVID-19 and it makes sense to install this application at hospitals. Though this application is used for hospital but with few changes it can also be used in many other real life applications for example checking whether people are wearing face mask at public places or not etc...

Face-mask detection:
The face mask detection was developed using simple machine learning model called SVM(Support Vector Machines) and in addition to that a PCA(Principal Component Analysis) was performed for feature extraction which gave use 92% accuracy in detecting face mask detection.

Face Recognition:
The face recognition module was developed using an python third party library called face-recognition module developed by MIT and it produced an accuracy of 99.38%.

Even a research paper was published based on this project in IJCRT journal. The link as follows:
